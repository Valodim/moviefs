MovieFS

This is a fuse application implemented in python that will project a database
of movies into a virtual filesystem.

Implemented filesystems:
 - actor: list all actors with 3+ movies
 - director: group movies by director
 - genre: group movies by genre
 - imdb: juts show all movies by imdb-id
 - runtime: group movies by runtime, granularity of 10
 - title: just show all movies by title
 - year: group movies by year

It's all very alpha and hardly of use, but feel free to look around.
